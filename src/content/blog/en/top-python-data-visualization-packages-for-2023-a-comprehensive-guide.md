In today's data-centric world, effectively visualizing complex data has become increasingly vital. Building on our recent exploration of R data visualization, accessible [here](https://datanautes.com/en/top-data-visualization-packages-for-r-a-guide-for-2023/), we focus on Python, a formidable force in data science. Join us as we uncover the top Python data visualization packages to watch in 2023.



## Matplotlib: The Veteran

Discussion of Python data visualization would only be complete with Matplotlib. This robust package, renowned for its longevity, enables crafting visualizations ranging from straightforward to intricate.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [11, 22, 25, 33]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

## Seaborn: Statistical Data Visualization

Seaborn builds upon Matplotlib's foundation, offering a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

```python
import seaborn as sns

sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid")
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
sns.boxplot(x=tips["total_bill"])
```
## Plotly: Interactive Graphs

Plotly stands out with its ability to create interactive plots that can be embedded into web applications.

```python
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species")
fig.show()

```

## Bokeh: Streamlined Web Integration

For seamless integration into web applications, Bokeh is your go-to package. It facilitates the creation of interactive and real-time streaming plots.

```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show

p = figure(title = "simple line example")
p.line([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 7], line_width = 2)
show(p)
```
