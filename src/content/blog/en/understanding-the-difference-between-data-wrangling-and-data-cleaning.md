In data analytics, it is important to understand the different data preparation phases. Two crucial phases in this process are **data preparation** and **data cleaning**. Let's take a closer look at the nuances of these two terms.

## Data Cleaning

### **Definition**

Data cleaning refers to the process where errors and inconsistencies in data are identified and subsequently corrected or removed, thereby enhancing its quality.

### **Scope**

This stage encompasses tasks such as handling missing values, smoothing noisy data, detecting and removing outliers, and sorting out inconsistencies in the data.

### **Techniques**

Some standard techniques involved in data cleaning are:

- **Imputation of missing values:** Replacing missing data with statistical estimates of the missing values.
- **Outlier detection and removal:** Identifying and removing data points that deviate significantly from most data.
- **Data transformation:** Including normalization or standardization to make the data conform to a standard scale.
- **Error correction:** Rectifying typos and spelling mistakes that might have occurred during data entry.

### **Goal**

The ultimate goal of data cleaning is to curate a clean, consistent, accurate dataset, ready to undergo deeper analysis.

## Data Wrangling (or Data Munging)

### **Definition**

Data wrangling, a broader process, involves transforming and mapping data from a "raw" format into another, facilitating more convenient data consumption and analysis.

### **Scope**

Data wrangling is a comprehensive process incorporating a wide range of activities, including but not limited to data cleaning. It may involve data transformation, data enrichment, and even data visualization.

### **Techniques**

The techniques often used in data wrangling include:

- **Parsing data files:** This could involve interpreting files such as XML or JSON.
- **Data reshaping:** Such as pivoting or melting datasets to get the data into a more usable format.
- **Data merging/joining:** This entails combining data from multiple sources to enrich the dataset.
- **Creating new derived columns:** To add new perspectives and insights to the dataset.
- **Converting data types:** Altering the data type of columns for consistent data analysis.
- **Data aggregation:** This includes operations where data is summarized into groups.

### **Goal**

Data wrangling aims to transform data into a structured format, making it significantly easier to analyze and facilitating its use in data modeling or machine learning tasks.

## Conclusion

While data cleaning can be seen as a subset of data wrangling, it is essential to note that it involves a broader set of operations on data. Data cleaning focuses mainly on enhancing data quality, while data wrangling is about transforming and mapping data into a more analyzable and usable format.
